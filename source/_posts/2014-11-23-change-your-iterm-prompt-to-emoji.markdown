Hello and welcome to my tutorial on how to further
customize your iTerm. This tutorial follows
[my previous tutorial](http://yoderbacon.com/blog/2014/10/22/how-to-customize-iterm/)
on how to customize the colors and background of iTerm to
make it more visually pleasing.  

In this tutorial we are going to change our prompt to
have an emoji instead of a dollar sign ($), which can
be seen in the following screenshot.

When we left off in the last tutorial we ended up with
a terminal window similar to this:

## Let's do that change thing!

The first thing you're going to want to do is open your
bash profile. I'm also assuming you have one made already
are, at least, mildly aware that it exists. Open up iTerm
and navigate to your root directory. If terminal hasn't
opened in your root directory the easiest way to get
there is to type `cd` in and push enter.

From your root directory, open up your bash profile in
Text Edit, the built in Mac text editor. The simple way
to do this is to type:
`open .bash_profile`
in your terminal. You should get something like the
following:
