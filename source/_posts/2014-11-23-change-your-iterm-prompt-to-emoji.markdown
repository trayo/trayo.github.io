Hello and welcome to my tutorial on how to further
customize your iTerm. This tutorial follows
[my previous tutorial](http://yoderbacon.com/blog/2014/10/22/how-to-customize-iterm/)
on how to customize the colors and background of iTerm to
make it more visually pleasing.  

In this tutorial we are going to change our prompt to
have an emoji instead of the dollar sign ($) that you've seen.

When we left off in the last tutorial we ended up with
a terminal window similar to this:
